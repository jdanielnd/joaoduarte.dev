Those who have worked with us or know [a bit of our history](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gente-foi-o-segredo-do-nosso-sucesso-matheus-goyas/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BxpLveZjQQoiV%2BIp%2FnWhLnw%3D%3D&) know that **people** are our main focus. We sleep and wake up thinking about the well-being and success of the people around us. Not surprisingly, the mission of AppProva has always been to **create more opportunities for people**, both for those who use our products and those who helped build them.

**Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in this journey.**

### How did we get here?

We started AppProva in 2012 as a group of people who wanted to make an impact on the world. Many of these people were already working in education, but for me, it was a moment of discovery of **purpose**.

Since then, we have impacted millions of students throughout Brazil and built a fantastic story with **hundreds of hands**.

In 2017, we were acquired by Somos Educação, where we spent another two years learning a lot and working daily to **help improve education in Brazil**.

At the beginning of 2019, we started a reflection together on what would come next. We knew we wanted to continue together and that we wanted to work on something that had **purpose** and **impact** on the world.

We traveled around the world, seeing firsthand what has been happening in the US, Europe, and China, and studied various sectors. And what caught our attention the most was how **the job market is rapidly and silently transforming**.

### Starting a new chapter
We see in this transformation an opportunity to start a new chapter in our **people-focused journey**.

The technological transformations that the world has experienced in recent years have drastically changed the profile of the workforce. **Digital professions have gained space and are increasingly in demand**.

On the other hand, **the educational system has not been able to keep up with these changes**, which results in two consequences:

1. people are preparing for an outdated job market;
2. companies are having difficulty finding qualified professionals.

### And that's where Trybe comes in

Trybe is a school for the future, founded with the purpose of **creating meaningful opportunities** for anyone who wants to improve their lives and **build a successful career in technology**.

We remain obsessed with the well-being and success of the people around us. **And people are our focus at Trybe**. We sleep and wake up thinking about the success of both our students and our employees.

That's why we have made a genuine commitment to our students. At Trybe, they **only start paying when they get a job** that pays at least R$ 3,500.00.

This guarantees an alignment of interests, where Trybe's success needs to go hand in hand with the success of our students, and **demonstrates respect for the time and money of the people** who place their trust in Trybe to build a successful career.

I am very happy to be once again **surrounded by people I admire so much**, working to **solve a relevant problem**, and waking up every day with purpose to **leave a mark in the world**.
