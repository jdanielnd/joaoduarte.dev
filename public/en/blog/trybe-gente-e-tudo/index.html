  <p>Those who have worked with us or know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gente-foi-o-segredo-do-nosso-sucesso-matheus-goyas/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BxpLveZjQQoiV%2BIp%2FnWhLnw%3D%3D&amp;">a bit of our history</a> know that <strong>people</strong> are our main focus. We sleep and wake up thinking about the well-being and success of the people around us. Not surprisingly, the mission of AppProva has always been to <strong>create more opportunities for people</strong>, both for those who use our products and those who helped build them.</p>
<p><strong>Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in this journey.</strong></p>
<h3 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h3>
<p>We started AppProva in 2012 as a group of people who wanted to make an impact on the world. Many of these people were already working in education, but for me, it was a moment of discovery of <strong>purpose</strong>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have impacted millions of students throughout Brazil and built a fantastic story with <strong>hundreds of hands</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2017, we were acquired by Somos EducaÃ§Ã£o, where we spent another two years learning a lot and working daily to <strong>help improve education in Brazil</strong>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2019, we started a reflection together on what would come next. We knew we wanted to continue together and that we wanted to work on something that had <strong>purpose</strong> and <strong>impact</strong> on the world.</p>
<p>We traveled around the world, seeing firsthand what has been happening in the US, Europe, and China, and studied various sectors. And what caught our attention the most was how <strong>the job market is rapidly and silently transforming</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-new-chapter">Starting a new chapter</h3>
<p>We see in this transformation an opportunity to start a new chapter in our <strong>people-focused journey</strong>.</p>
<p>The technological transformations that the world has experienced in recent years have drastically changed the profile of the workforce. <strong>Digital professions have gained space and are increasingly in demand</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>the educational system has not been able to keep up with these changes</strong>, which results in two consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are preparing for an outdated job market;</li>
<li>companies are having difficulty finding qualified professionals.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="and-thats-where-trybe-comes-in">And that&rsquo;s where Trybe comes in</h3>
<p>Trybe is a school for the future, founded with the purpose of <strong>creating meaningful opportunities</strong> for anyone who wants to improve their lives and <strong>build a successful career in technology</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/trybe-hub-bh-1.jpeg" alt="Trybe&amp;rsquo;s hub in BH"></p>
<p>We remain obsessed with the well-being and success of the people around us. <strong>And people are our focus at Trybe</strong>. We sleep and wake up thinking about the success of both our students and our employees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have made a genuine commitment to our students. At Trybe, they <strong>only start paying when they get a job</strong> that pays at least R$ 3,500.00.</p>
<p>This guarantees an alignment of interests, where Trybe&rsquo;s success needs to go hand in hand with the success of our students, and <strong>demonstrates respect for the time and money of the people</strong> who place their trust in Trybe to build a successful career.</p>
<p><img src="/images/trybe-hub-bh-2.jpeg" alt="Trybe&amp;rsquo;s hub in BH"></p>
<p>I am very happy to be once again <strong>surrounded by people I admire so much</strong>, working to <strong>solve a relevant problem</strong>, and waking up every day with purpose to <strong>leave a mark in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in studying at Trybe, please visit our website <a href="https://betrybe.com">https://betrybe.com</a> and apply for our selection process! Today we have hubs in Belo Horizonte and SÃ£o Paulo, and soon we will have more hubs throughout Brazil.</p>
<p>We are also growing the team and hiring a lot. If you want to be part of Trybe, send me a message on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you!! #vqv #gotrybe</strong></p>
