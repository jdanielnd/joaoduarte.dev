      <description>I bought this book in 2015 at the MIT Coop, a bookstore/cooperative founded at Harvard in 1882, and which continues to serve Harvard and MIT students to this day.
Since then, I believe I have read this book about 4 or 5 times. And it has helped me a lot each time.
I have a curious mind that wants to learn a little bit of everything. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an essentialist spirit, but I have a great admiration for those who have that focus and discipline.</description>

      <description>Those who have worked with us or know a bit of our history know that people are our main focus. We sleep and wake up thinking about the well-being and success of the people around us. Not surprisingly, the mission of AppProva has always been to create more opportunities for people, both for those who use our products and those who helped build them.
Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in this journey.</description>

      <description>It is very common to imagine a software engineer as a solitary genius who likes to work alone, reclusive, and does not need anyone else to solve any problem that may arise.
It is true that for some time, computing has attracted people with more introspective personalities. But what has been happening is that the teams that have achieved the greatest long-term success are those that see software development as a team sport.</description>
