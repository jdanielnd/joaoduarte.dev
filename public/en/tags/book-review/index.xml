      <description>I bought this book in 2015 at the MIT Coop, a bookstore/cooperative founded at Harvard in 1882, and which continues to serve Harvard and MIT students to this day.
Since then, I believe I have read this book about 4 or 5 times. And it has helped me a lot each time.
I have a curious mind that wants to learn a little bit of everything. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an essentialist spirit, but I have a great admiration for those who have that focus and discipline.</description>
