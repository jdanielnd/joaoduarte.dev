      <title>Why I&#39;m building a database from scratch (and why you should too)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series: How Databases Work: Building a PostgreSQL-Inspired DB in Rust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-production-incident-that-ignited-this-idea&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The production incident that ignited this idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we had a database performance crisis at work. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your typical &amp;ldquo;missing index&amp;rdquo; problem. The system would run fine for hours, handling thousands of queries across multiple indexes. Then, seemingly randomly, query times would degrade from milliseconds to seconds. The database wasn&amp;rsquo;t out of memory. CPU wasn&amp;rsquo;t maxed. Rows fetched peaking afterwards, which looked&amp;hellip; weird, but not obviously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought this book in 2015 at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.thecoop.com/mit/&#34;&gt;MIT Coop&lt;/a&gt;, a bookstore/cooperative founded at Harvard in 1882, and which continues to serve Harvard and MIT students to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I believe I have read this book about 4 or 5 times. And it has helped me a lot each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a curious mind that wants to learn a little bit of everything. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an essentialist spirit, but I have a great admiration for those who have that focus and discipline. I am aware that I can improve a lot when I walk in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who have worked with us or know &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gente-foi-o-segredo-do-nosso-sucesso-matheus-goyas/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BxpLveZjQQoiV%2BIp%2FnWhLnw%3D%3D&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;a bit of our history&lt;/a&gt; know that &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; are our main focus. We sleep and wake up thinking about the well-being and success of the people around us. Not surprisingly, the mission of AppProva has always been to &lt;strong&gt;create more opportunities for people&lt;/strong&gt;, both for those who use our products and those who helped build them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in this journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Software development is a team sport</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/posts/desenvolvimento-software-esporte-coletivo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is very common to imagine a software engineer as a solitary genius who likes to work alone, reclusive, and does not need anyone else to solve any problem that may arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is true that for some time, computing has attracted people with more introspective personalities. But what has been happening is that the teams that have achieved the greatest long-term success are those that see software development as a team sport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
